Check out the latest episode of Get Kafka-Nated! I had a fantastic conversation with Satish D from Uber, who was a key contributor to KIP 405 that brought tiered storage to Kafka.

We explored what tiered storage actually is, the specific storage challenges at Uber that led to KIP 405, and the biggest technical hurdles in implementing such a fundamental change to Kafka. Satish shared insights on working with the Apache community process including why it can take so long to get major KIPs into open-source Kafka.

I really getting to interview another member of the community who was directly involved in architecting one of Kafka's most significant features. Check out the recording below.
