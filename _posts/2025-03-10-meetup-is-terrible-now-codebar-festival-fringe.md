On Saturday I had the pleasure of speaking at the [codebar](https://codebar.io/) Festival Fringe at Newspeak House about my thoughts on the decline of Meetup and approaches for tackling platform decline in the community organising space and elsewhere.

The community came together to raise hundreds for codebar and it was a privilege to get to speak alongside such fantastic speakers with lightning talks from Willow S. on obsolesce proofing your smart home, Kourosh Simpkins on watching the implications of watching (deep-faked) politicians play Minecraft, and Keegan R. with what has to be the single most entertaining talk on box packing ever (I'm still a little in awe).

Thank you to Leo Riviera and Melissa Tranfield for hosting and organising, I'm sure you did Kimberley Cook proud!
