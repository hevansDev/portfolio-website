My last week at Imply was at Druid Summit, it was an absolute pleasure working alongside my former colleagues Reena Leone, Peter Marshall, and Dave Klein running the event and getting to see so many excellent presentations from members of the Druid community. I organized all the panels for the 2024 event and you can see the recording of the Ops and Optimization panel I hosted below.
