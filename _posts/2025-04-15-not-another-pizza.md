## Part 1 : If I never see another pizza again, it'll be too soon.

The year is 2022, I am a know-nothing twenty-something cloud consultant working at [Daemon Solutions](https://dae.mn), a boutique IT consultancy based in London. [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/) has just been launched and Daemon has created a brand-new practice with the business to focus on client engagements focused on AI and Machine Learning, and a colleague approaches me to see if I would be interested in helping to host the AI meetup (at the time called Enterprise Deep Learning and AI UK) the company has just adopted with a view towards helping to promote this new practice.

Now three years later I'm still a know-nothing twenty-something, but now I've organised 22 [AI and Deep Learning for Enterprise]() events, been a committee member for three conferences, and had a hand in helping to host and organised several other tech leaning events in the capital. Community organising and participating in technical communities in London has led me to all kinds of interesting places like speaking at events, learning new skills like running AV and doing video editing, and it’s even got me a job or two. Community organising has also left me more burnt out that I've ever been in my life.

Organising and hosting community events (particularly solo as I have done on occasion) is exhausting. If you are putting on an event once a month which for a while is what we were doing at AIDLE means the work is essentially unending - by the time you have wrapped up with one event you immediately move on to organising the next (if you haven't already). Hosting events can also be surprisingly physically demanding: moving furniture, running to grab stacks of beer and soft drinks, and lugging AV kit on the tube on top of the late nights can leave you physically exhausted - particularly whilst also having to put on a friendly face and look after attendees and speakers. Oh, and you'll be doing all of that on an empty stomach unless you can snag a slice of cold pizza before it's all gone.

Needless to say I would not still be involved in organising events without a lot of support. Support from other organisers who gave advice and promoted events and collaborated on events, from friends who came along to help out running AV and taking pictures, and from sponsors and hosts who provided funding and venues. Co-organisers are perhaps the greatest source of support because the difference in the feeling of doing something alone versus being part of a team cannot be overstated. Something I wish I had starting out was a way to find other organisers to collaborate with and share resources with, I've met some great organsiers over the last three years, but it took a long time.

## Part 2: It was never about the Pizza (sorry)

After the last three years of being in technical communities both as an organiser and as a regular member I've eaten a lot of pizza, I used to really like Pizza - now I like it a lot less - I know I'm not alone in this. [Not Another Pizza](https://notanother.pizza) then is a fun little name for a group for community organisers, but (and you'll have to forgive me for this) the pizza isn't pizza, it's an analogy.

Pizza is a stand in for all the bare minimum requirements of hosting an event: the food yes, but also venues, AV, community event platforms ([on which I have _thoughts_]({{ site.baseurl }}/meetup-is-terrible-now-codebar-festival-fringe/)), and so on. Of course community organisers need these things, but often as an organiser you'll find yourself reaching for something more: collaborators, advice on tracking community growth and retention, tools to help automate away the drudgery of managing guest lists, resources on managing codes of conduct and code of conduct violations, and maybe a sympatheic ear from someone from time to time. Think soul food, not cold pizza.

The vision for Not Another Pizza then is a support network for dev advocates, community managers, and event organisers that can help provide some of these things. There are some great communities and resources out there already doing this like the [Developer Marketing Alliance](https://dev-mar-com.slack.com), but I've found that resources and collaboration opportunities can be very dependant on geography so wanted to set something up more focused on organising technical communities in London and the UK in general.

The London community landscape is highly concentrated around the City with most communities relying on access to free or subsidised event spaces rather than paying through the nose for renting event spaces. We are also rapidly approaching "peak meetup" with several events on the same topic on any given night. I don't see the large number of organisers in London as a problem though - we as organisers don't need to compete for limited resources and venues if instead organisers and groups collaborate to pool resources and shoulder the work of organising events together. London then is the perfect environment for building this kind of meta-community of community organisers.

My hope is that Not Another Pizza can foster meaningful connections between organisers and serve to facilitate meaningful collaboration beyond being just another networking event. 

## Part 3: The real pizza was the friends we made along the way

It's very early days yet, but some friends and I are working on building out our community by inviting other dev rel professionals and organisers to the [Discord community](https://discord.notanother.pizza) and building out the website. We've also been building out a catalogoue of projects on the site that members of the group have been working on, our growing list of projects includes [stickers](https://notanother.pizza/projects/#:~:text=Slices%20of%20Not%20Another%20Pizza%20goodness) a laptop sticker annotation tool, and [bridge](https://notanother.pizza/projects/#:~:text=on%20GitHub.-,bridge,-POSSE%20for%20community) an API for managing community events across platforms.

In future I'd love for us to create spaces for authentic collaboration by enabling organisers to share success stories of collaborations born through Not Another Pizza, providing match making for mentorship opportunities, hosting a library of useful resources and content, and to become a really great place to get help with community organising. Perhaps in future we could even have some in person events, who knows.

If Not Another Pizza sounds like a useful resource you can join the discord community over at [discord.notanother.pizza](https://discord.notanother.pizza) and checkout out our website over at [notanother.pizza](https://notanother.pizza) for updates or to find projects to get involved in.
