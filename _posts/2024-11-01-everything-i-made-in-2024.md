**I made a lot of things this year**
including mistakes: I started the year out of a job having been let go from a Senior Platform Engineer Role that I'd struggled in and hadn't been enjoying because I'd pursued a Senior role before I was ready. In the months between the end of that role and the beginning of the next I had a lot of time to reflect, to try and understand what hadn't worked in my previous role, and to think about the kinds of work I might find more rewarding. Certainly the work had been challenging but beyond that I had found it hard to find the motivation to up-skill myself and push beyond my comfort zone to meet the expectations placed on me, I just hadn't been to focus on the task in front of me.

I can often find it hard to focus (particularly at work) but my entire life one thing that has never failed to hold my attention is making things. As a child my room was dominated by a cardboard city that wrapped around my desk and bed, as a teenager I built and tinkered with 3D printers, and my first job was teaching digital making to NCS students over the Summer of 2018. I came to realize that if I wanted to find a job that would provide me with work I would be passionate to do and that I could actually keep I needed to find a job that would give me opportunities to make things because only then would I get to create, to learn, and to collaborate with others.

Developer Advocacy had long been interesting to me and in many ways a dream job, not least because of the number of talented creative people I had seen doing that kind of work, combing my interests of making, technology, and community work. In March of 2024 I was delighted (and a little surprised) to be hired into my first role as a Developer Advocate helping to support the [Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org/) community. What followed was an exciting and challenging year learning the ropes, building demos, and meeting some great people before sadly many of my colleagues and I were made redundant. Writing now I again find myself out of work with the end of the year rapidly approaching I want to again reflect on the past year and the lessons it has to offer.

Life for me is (occasionally) neatly divided into time spent working on projects - in this blog I'd like to revisit some of the projects I worked on and share what I learned from each one.
