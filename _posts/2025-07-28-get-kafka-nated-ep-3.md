Check out the latest episode of Get Kafka-Nated! I had a fantastic conversation with Greg Harris about his work on KIP-1150 and life as an open source software engineer.

We dove deep into the technical architecture, explored the challenges of implementing this game-changing feature, and discussed what Diskless topics mean for the future of real-time data streaming.
