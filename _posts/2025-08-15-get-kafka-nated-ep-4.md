Check out the latest episode of Get Kafka-Nated! I had a fantastic conversation with Alex Merced, Head of DevRel at Dremio and co-author of "Apache Iceberg: The Definitive Guide," about why Iceberg is becoming essential for streaming data architectures.

We explored how Apache Iceberg is blurring the lines between streaming and analytics, discussed the exciting new "Iceberg Topics" development that makes Kafka topics directly queryable as tables, and dove into real-world patterns for integrating Kafka with modern data lakehouses.

Alex shared insights from his work with enterprises adopting lakehouse architectures, explained how schema evolution works in streaming scenarios, and gave practical advice for teams looking to add Iceberg to their Kafka-based data pipelines.
