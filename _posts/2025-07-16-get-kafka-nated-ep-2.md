Check out the second episode of Get Kafka - Nated! I had a great time chatting with Josep Prat about his experiences as a Kafka Contributor and Apache Kafka PMC member. We covered everything from first open source contributions to how to properly manage a major open source project.

[Tune in next time](https://www.linkedin.com/events/getkafka-natedepisode3-gregharr7351967184987779074/theater/) for a conversation with Greg Harris about KIP-1150 which introduces Diskless topics to Apache Kafka.
