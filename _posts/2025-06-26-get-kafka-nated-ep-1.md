Check out the first episode of Get Kafka - Nated! Filip Yonov and I had a great chat exploring everything from Kafka's journey from on-prem to the cloud, this years major Kafka improvement proposals, to what we're excited about for the future of Kafka.

Tune in next time for a conversation with Josep Prat about life as a Kafka contributor.
