### Hi, I'm Hugh.

I write posts on a mixture of topics, mostly how to guides but also the occasional long form post on general technical topics I find interesting - often as companion pieces to talks covering those topics.

I work as a DevOps consultant at [Daemon Solutions](dae.mn). Previously I've worked as a software developer both as a consultant at Daemon and as a full stack developer on the IBM spectrum virtualize SAN storage product, and a workshop facilitator for the Raspberry Pi Foundation. 

Since December 2022 I have been organising a monthly, in person Meetup [(AI and Deep Learning for Enterprise)](https://www.meetup.com/enterprise-deep-learning-ai-uk) focused on deep learning and MLOps. I'm very new to community organising but it's been an exciting challenge and I'm looking forward to seeing AI and Deep Learning for Enterprise continue to grow.

I'm helping Daemon Solutions to combat climate change by working to achieve Net Zero carbon dioxide emissions by leading the Environment working group which is currently building and implementing a plan for reducing and offsetting carbon dioxides emissions by 2030.
