### Hi, I'm Hugh.

I'm an AWS Cloud Engineer at [Featurespace](featurespace.com) where I help to build our cloud infrastructure, prior to this I worked as a DevOps consultant at [Daemon Solutions](dae.mn).

I write posts on a mixture of topics, mostly how to guides but also the occasional long form post on general technical topics I find interesting - often as companion pieces to talks covering those topics.

I began my career working as a full stack developer at IBM (after I completed my apprenticeship there) on the Spectrum Virtualize SAN storage product. Whilst completing my A'Levels during the summer of 2018 I was a workshop facilitator for the Raspberry Pi Foundation as part of their NCS program. 

Out of office hours I organise AI and Deep Learning for Enterprise (aidle.uk) , a Meetup group which hosts talks on real world applications of AI including the ethics and environmental impact of the use of AI.
