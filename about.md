### Hi, I'm Hugh.

I'm an experienced developer advocate and community manager with a particular interest in data and AI. I have been working in IT for over 5 years, working on large scale software projects and cloud infrastructure.

Out of office hours I organise AI and Deep Learning for Enterprise (aidle.uk) , a Meetup group which hosts talks on real world applications of AI.

I'm a former apprentice and an advocate for vocational learning as a pathway into an IT career.
