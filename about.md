### Hi, I'm Hugh.

I'm a Software Engineer with 5 years of experience working on large scale software projects and cloud infrastructure.

I began my career working as a full stack developer at IBM (after I completed my apprenticeship there) on the Spectrum Virtualize SAN storage product. Whilst completing my A'Levels during the summer of 2018 I was a workshop facilitator for the Raspberry Pi Foundation as part of their NCS program. 

Out of office hours I organise [AI and Deep Learning for Enterprise](aidle.uk), a Meetup group which hosts talks on real world applications of AI including the ethics and environmental impact of the use of AI.

I'm a former apprentice and an advocate for vocational learning as a pathway into an IT career.
